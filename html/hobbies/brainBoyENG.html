                    <p>
                        A few months ago I discovered the Mega Memory Card, a Gameboy Color accessory designed to make backups of
                        Game Boy saves. This cartridge was very attractive to me as it eliminates terror of many cartridge collectors: 
                        battery depletion. Despite having a simple solution, this problem frightens many people who are inexperienced 
                        in soldering. Sadly, I realized that the cartridge is relatively rare, and the easiest way to get it is through
                        importation (I live in Brazil), so it would be VERY expensive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was already giving up the search for it when I found the Brain Boy, a cartridge that was created to be a 
                        cheating device in the Pokemon games. Unfortunately, there are few websites with descriptions about the 
                        cartridge, and information about it allowing backup was VERY sparse, so I ended up risking buying it, and 
                        luckly my bet was successful, I finally got a cartridge that performs backups of Gameboy games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Brain Boy is a cartridge created by the company 'Pelican Accessories' in the early 2000s, and its focus was
                        allow cheating in the first three games in the Pokemon series (Red, Blue and Yellow). It is worth noting that the
                        device is not compatible with Game Boy Classic, only its successors, due to the lock on the 'on' button
                        of the videogame. In addition to cheating, it also allows you to speed up the game speed, color the game with a palette
                        pre-defined, create your own color palette for the games, and finally, perform backups.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To be honest, I ignored the non-backup functions, so there's no analysis into the other features in the video I 
                        made. Brain Boy has a flash memory that makes available 200 blocks to allocate any game that has the native 
                        save function in the game (cartridges that uses battery). Despite this, not the entire Game Boy/Gameboy Color 
                        game library is compatible with the device, so I decided to register all the games I tried in the table below. 
                        The space occupied in blocks is relative to a backup of the beginning of the game (for Pokemon it would be the 
                        equivalent of geting your initial, and going to the second city, and in the case of Zelda, would get the shield). 
                        In addition to the tests, I left a bunch of files of the instruction manual and the game box, as I hope this will help 
                        the Retro community with more information about the accessory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Brain Boy is not a common accessory, but I hope with the knowledge of it, and the other backup methods
                        that I mention in my video, you can keep your game saves!
                    </p>
